## Final Website Project for HTML and CSS Course

The purpose of this project was to combine all of the elements of what I had learned 
during the HTML and CSS courses as well as building a function in JavaScript. All of 
this work was done in Visual Studio Community 2015.

After the project was over, I came back to it to practice adding a map to a web page.
The map is from Mapbox, and adding it was surprisingly easy.
